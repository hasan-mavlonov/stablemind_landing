"""Birth a character from a biography (Temperament / genesis -- Slice 1).

    python genesis.py "Aisha, 24, an anxious but disciplined medical student..."
        -> seeds identity + OCEAN baseline (mu) + per-trait stickiness (tau),
           starts the current traits AT the baseline (x = mu), and saves the
           character to data/personality.json.

    python genesis.py
        -> demo: two contrasting bios side by side, showing they yield distinct
           temperaments (nothing is saved).

The primary seed is DeepSeek; without a key it falls back to a heuristic, so this
runs with no network.
