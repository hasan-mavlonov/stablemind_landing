"""CHARACTER: the values and habits a person accumulates from experience.

Where ``temperament`` is the innate OCEAN baseline a character is *born* with,
CHARACTER is what they *become* by living -- modeled as the ten Schwartz basic values
(``config.VALUES``) plus the habits they fall into. Both form from experience:

  * values -- moved every turn by ``values.values_push_from_text`` with the same
    diminishing-returns dynamics as the traits (``updater.apply_diminishing``);
  * habits -- a recurring experience (counted by ``memory.recurrence``) that crosses
    ``config.HABIT_MIN_RECURRENCE`` becomes a named habit.

State lives in ``personality["character"] = {"values": {...}, "habits": [...]}`` and
persists with the rest of the character. Values start at 0 -- earned, not innate --
which is exactly what separates CHARACTER (experience) from TEMPERAMENT (biology).
