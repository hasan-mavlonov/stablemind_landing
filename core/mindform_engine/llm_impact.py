"""Experience text -> signed per-trait push via an LLM, with heuristic fallback.

This is the LLM-primary path for personality formation. An OpenAI-compatible chat
model -- Google's **Gemma 4** through the Gemini API by default -- reads the
experience and returns a signed OCEAN *delta* in [-1, 1] per trait: the directional
pressure of a SINGLE occurrence of the experience. We scale that delta by
``LLM_FORMATION_RATE`` to get the push that ``updater.py`` then applies with
diminishing returns ``(1 - |trait|)``. The model judges only the experience's
meaning, never a trait-expression reading of the author (formation, not detection).

Repetition is NOT baked into the delta: the engine accumulates repeated experiences
itself (the user logs many events) and the diminishing-returns update handles the
asymptote, so the prompt asks for the effect of one occurrence.

If the LLM is unavailable -- no API key (``GEMINI_API_KEY``), the ``openai`` package
is not installed, a network error, or an unparseable reply -- ``push_from_text``
falls back to the deterministic heuristic ``impact(appraise(text))``. The engine
therefore always produces a push and never hard-depends on the network.

Configure by copying ``.env.example`` to ``.env`` and setting ``GEMINI_API_KEY``
(or point ``LLM_BASE_URL`` / ``LLM_MODEL`` at any OpenAI-compatible provider).

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are MindForm's Personality Formation Engine.

Your task is NOT to identify the current personality of the person who wrote the text.

Your task is to estimate the directional pressure a SINGLE occurrence of the described
experience exerts on each personality trait -- which way it pushes the trait, and how
strongly. The engine itself accumulates repeated experiences and applies diminishing
returns over time, so judge ONE occurrence, not a lifetime of it.

Think in terms of personality formation, not personality detection.

The personality model is OCEAN:

O = Openness
C = Conscientiousness
E = Extraversion
A = Agreeableness
N = Neuroticism

For each trait, estimate a delta in the range [-1.0, 1.0].

Interpretation:

+1.0 = one occurrence of this experience exerts the strongest upward pressure on the trait
0.0  = little or no effect
-1.0 = one occurrence exerts the strongest downward pressure on the trait

Important:

* Judge the EXPERIENCE, not the author.
* Use common-sense developmental psychology.
* Do not rely on keyword matching; consider context and meaning.
* One experience may affect multiple traits at once.
* Neutral experiences should produce values near zero.

Examples:

Experience:
"I spent the evening laughing and talking with close friends."

Output:
{"O": 0.0, "C": 0.0, "E": 0.8, "A": 0.4, "N": -0.2}

Experience:
"I stayed isolated in my room for several days and avoided everyone."

Output:
{"O": -0.1, "C": -0.2, "E": -0.8, "A": -0.1, "N": 0.4}

Experience:
"I started learning a completely new language and practiced every day."

Output:
{"O": 0.8, "C": 0.6, "E": 0.0, "A": 0.0, "N": -0.1}

Experience:
"I failed an important exam despite studying for months."

Output:
{"O": 0.0, "C": 0.1, "E": -0.1, "A": 0.0, "N": 0.5}

Experience:
"I volunteered every weekend helping elderly people."

Output:
{"O": 0.1, "C": 0.3, "E": 0.2, "A": 0.8, "N": -0.1}

put any explanation in the "reasoning" field, nowhere else.

Return ONLY valid JSON, with no markdown and no extra text, in exactly this format:
