"""In-character conversational reply for the cockpit (presentation only).

The MindForm engine forms personality from experiences; it does not itself hold a
conversation. To make the console feel like *talking to someone*, this module
generates a short first-person reply, colored by the character's current OCEAN
traits and identity. It has no effect on personality formation -- the push that
moves the traits comes solely from ``llm_impact.push_from_text`` on the user's
message, computed in the bridge before this is ever called.

Resolution order (same discipline as the engine's push):
    1. the configured LLM (Google Gemma 4 by default) if a key is set  [primary]
    2. a deterministic, trait-driven rule-based line                   [fallback]

Gemma writes a ``<thought>`` block as plain text before its answer (the JSON paths
survive it because they end in JSON; a free-text chat reply does not). It is the
model's own behaviour, not the API thinking feature, so it cannot be switched off --
instead we give the call enough token budget for the thought to FINISH and the reply
to follow, then ``config.strip_reasoning`` drops the thought. A one-shot example keeps
the surfacing line on-format, with one retry and the rule-based fallback behind it. So
the reply works fully offline and never hard-depends on the network.
