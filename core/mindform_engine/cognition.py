"""COGNITIVE PATTERNS: the interpretation lens between perception and formation.

How a person *thinks* colours what they perceive. The engine appraises an experience the
same way for everyone (``appraisal.appraise``); this node bends that reading by who the
character currently is AND by what they remember, so the SAME event forms two different
people differently -- and lands differently on the same person depending on their past.

  * ``interpret(appraisal, personality, recalled, recalled_beliefs)`` -- tilts the
    appraisal vector:
      - by current OCEAN traits (Slice 1): anxious -> more perceived threat and a darker
        valence; open -> more novelty; agreeable -> warmer on social events.
      - by EPISODIC memory (Slice 2): recalled similar past episodes pull the valence and
        threat *toward how those felt* (a learned expectation / schema), and the more this
        resembles lived experience, the less novel it reads (familiarity damps novelty).
      - by SEMANTIC memory: recalled beliefs damp novelty and raise self-relevance by how
        firmly they're held -- "I already have a theory about this" reads as less
        surprising and more personally relevant, regardless of whether the belief itself
        is optimistic or grim (deliberately not a valence pull -- see ``_belief_tilt``).
    Deterministic; it colours the heuristic push (traits / values / moral all run through
    ``appraise -> impact``).
  * ``lens(personality, recalled, recalled_beliefs)`` -- the same tilts as an interpretive
    brief injected into the LLM push prompt, so the primary (Gemma) path is coloured too
    (it reads the raw text, not the appraisal). ``read_lens`` is the short version for
    display.

All biases are small (``config.COGNITION_GAIN`` / ``config.MEMORY_GAIN`` /
``config.BELIEF_TILT_GAIN``) and clamped, so perception is tinted, not overwhelmed. The
memory and belief pulls are *toward a bounded target* (each asymptotes once the reading
matches it) and temperament's pull-back keeps the perceive -> form -> perceive loop
stable, so the schema reinforces without running away.
