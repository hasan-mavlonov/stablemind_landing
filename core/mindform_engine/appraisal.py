"""Meaning extraction: experience text -> appraisal vector.

The appraisal vector is the experience representation that drives personality
formation -- the causal ingredients of change (valence, intensity, control,
outcome, ...), NOT a trait-expression reading. See ``config.APPRAISAL_SCHEMA``.

Resolution order:
    1. learned affect/appraisal head (appraisal_head.pth) if it has been trained
    2. heuristic lexicon extractor                       (always available)

There is deliberately no LLM/API dependency. The learned head is trained on
existing cross-sectional affect/appraisal corpora (see ``bootstrap/``), using a
frozen MiniLM-embedding + small regression-head recipe.
