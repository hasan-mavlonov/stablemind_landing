# carried ACTION READINESS (Frijda) -- {tendency, mode} -- is blended with inertia, voiced
# in the reply as an inclination, and CLOSES THE RING two ways:

#     softer, so everything forms less (the shy spiral, structurally damped: withdrawing

#     teaches approach hardest (a contingency gate on agency), threat trains inhibition
#     faster than mastered challenge extinguishes it (bad-is-stronger, mirroring
#     DRIVE_FRUST_GAIN), and a carried lean-in earns credit from how the next message
#     answers it (reception -- the signal Expression Slice 2 was deferred for).

    Open-weight models (Gemma included) sometimes wrap JSON in a markdown code
    fence, prepend a ``<thought>`` reasoning block, or add a stray sentence. We
    strip reasoning, then a leading/trailing fence, and -- failing a direct parse
    -- fall back to the outermost ``{...}`` span. Raises ValueError if no JSON
    object can be found, so the callers fall back to the heuristic.

# --- Memory / recurrence ---
RECURRENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.80   # cosine similarity to count as the "same" experience

# --- Temperament (genesis baseline + dynamics) ---
# A character is born (temperament.genesis) with a per-trait OCEAN baseline `mu`
# in [-1, 1] and a per-trait stickiness `tau` in [0, 1]. The current traits start
# AT the baseline (x = mu). DEFAULT_TAU is used when a seed leaves stickiness
# unspecified (and for blank / legacy characters).
#
# Every experience, updater.py applies the temperament dynamics:
#   x[k]  <- x[k] + tau[k] * (mu[k] - x[k])              # pull the trait back to baseline
#   mu[k] <- mu[k] + TEMPERAMENT_DRIFT * (x[k] - mu[k])  # baseline drifts toward lived state
# tau is the fraction of the gap to baseline closed per experience: high tau =
# resilient (snaps back), low tau = easily reshaped. TEMPERAMENT_DRIFT (eta) is the same
# idea for the baseline itself and stays << tau, so only a *sustained* shift moves your
# wiring. With the pull on, a repeated experience settles a trait at a fixed point
# between its baseline and the extreme rather than at the +/-1 wall.
DEFAULT_TAU = 0.30
TEMPERAMENT_DRIFT = 0.02   # eta: baseline plasticity per experience (must stay << tau)

# --- Cognitive Patterns (the interpretation lens) ---
# How you think colours what you perceive: the same event reads differently depending on
# the character's current traits. cognition.interpret() gently bends the appraisal (anxious
# -> more threat + darker; open -> more novelty; agreeable -> warmer socially), and
# cognition.lens() turns the same tilt into a one-line brief for the LLM push prompt. The
# gain is small and clamped, so perception is tinted, not overwhelmed -- and temperament's
# pull-back keeps the perceive -> form -> perceive loop from running away.
COGNITION_GAIN = 0.15
# Slice 2 -- memory/schema-driven interpretation: recalled similar past episodes pull the
# reading toward how those *felt* (a learned expectation), and familiarity damps novelty.
# The pull is toward a bounded target -- it asymptotes once the reading matches the memory,
# so it can't run away -- and is scaled by how closely the situation is recognised, so a
# faint match barely tints.
MEMORY_GAIN = 0.20

# --- Identity (immutable facts collected when a character is created) ---
# (field_key, prompt_label), in the order the creation form asks for them. These
# are stored verbatim in personality["identity"] and never drift. The separate
# free-text "background" blurb (not listed here) is what seeds temperament mu/tau.

# author sets the temperament directly instead of having it inferred from text.
