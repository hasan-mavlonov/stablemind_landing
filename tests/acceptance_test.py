"""Acceptance test: experience forms the traits, and temperament reins them in.

Dependency-free (no torch / numpy / sentence-transformers). Demonstrates the model:

  * a vivid experience moves a trait visibly on the FIRST occurrence (party: E ~0 -> ~0.2)
  * repeating it raises the trait by LESS each time (diminishing returns)
  * the push is signed: an experience can lower a trait, not only raise it
  * identical "fear" content moves N up (helpless) or down (mastery) via appraisal
  * TEMPERAMENT (Slice 2): the baseline pulls a trait back, so a repeated experience
    settles at a fixed point BETWEEN baseline and the extreme -- two characters with the
    same experiences but different temperaments diverge -- and a sustained shift slowly
    drifts the baseline itself.

Run: python3 acceptance_test.py
