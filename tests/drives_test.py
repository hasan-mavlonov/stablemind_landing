"""MOTIVATION & DRIVES: the SDT need-homeostat seeded by Schwartz values.

Dependency-free (pure arithmetic -- no torch / numpy / network), like the acceptance and
cognition suites. Proves the three claims of the slice:

  * SEED    -- the formed Schwartz values decide which of the three SDT needs matter.
  * HOMEOSTAT -- tension relaxes toward its resting weight, falls when an event feeds the
                 need and rises when it is denied, and stays bounded.
  * WANTING -- an ACTIVE (loud) need bends the appraisal: the same event reads as more
               goal-relevant and more positive when the character is starved for it, and a
               frustrating event reads as more threatening -- and a louder need bends harder.
