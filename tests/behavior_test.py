"""BEHAVIOR & LIFE OUTCOME: the enacted stance -- the loop, closed.

Dependency-free (pure arithmetic -- no torch / numpy / network; one optional memory-stamp
check skips without numpy). Proves the four claims of the slice:

  * TWO SYSTEMS -- approach (BAS) and inhibition (BIS) are independent formed sensitivities
                   anchored to the traits, so conflict (both loud) and apathy (both quiet)
                   exist, and dispositions are earned around trait set-points.
  * THE GATE    -- the carried stance scales how hard the next experience lands (intensity),
                   leaning in exposing, holding back muffling -- exactly attributable.
  * THE CREDIT  -- the world's answer trains the systems by the law of effect done right:
                   rewarded OWN action teaches approach hardest, threat trains inhibition
                   faster than mastery extinguishes it, kindness never entrenches
                   withdrawal, and a carried lean-in earns reception credit.
  * BOUNDED     -- the spiral damps (shrinking increments), a bright streak recovers a
                   withdrawn character (no lock-in), and everything stays in bounds.
