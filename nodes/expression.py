"""SOCIAL EXPRESSION: the outward voice -- how the inner state comes OUT.

The output-side twin of the cognitive lens. Where ``cognition.interpret``/``lens`` bend how
the world gets *in*, this node shapes how the self gets *out*: a communication STYLE on the
interpersonal-circumplex axes -- assertion, warmth, energy, strain -- derived fresh each turn
(no stored state) from:

  * the SELF-VIEW, not the raw traits: we perform who we THINK we are (Goffman), so a
    character whose self-image lags its real traits still *talks* like the old self;
  * self-regard (``self.esteem``): confidence asserts plainly, doubt hedges;
  * the collective pressure of unmet needs (``drives``): starvation strains the voice.

Around the dims, three wordable signals: the ACTIVE NEED (the Motivation -> voice edge --
what they most lack shows in what they reach for), the DOMINANT VALUE, and THIS TURN'S MOOD
read from the *interpreted* appraisal -- so the same event is answered brightly by the secure
character and braced by the anxious one (the lens drives the mouth).

Two mouths read one derivation:
  * ``voice()``       -- a short imperative brief injected into the LLM reply prompt;
  * ``plain_reply()`` -- the deterministic offline reply: the same dims drive its SHAPE
                         (hedged openers, a reach toward the other, a length budget, a worry
                         tail), so two characters sound different with no LLM at all.

Slice 2 made the style a FORMED layer: the Slice-1 derivation (``style_target``) is now the
SET-POINT -- what the inner state calls for -- and the persisted style
(``personality["expression"]``) forms around it. It relaxes toward the target each turn
(manner lags inner change: the newly-confident character still sounds tentative for a
while) and is operantly shaped by RECEPTION (``behavior.reception`` -- the next incoming
message read as how the last utterance landed): the manner actually spoken with is
entrenched when it is answered warmly and extinguished when it is rebuffed. The gap
between the formed style and its target is a learned mannerism, rendered as a ghost tick.
Pure arithmetic; no LLM, no numpy -- it degrades exactly like every other node.
