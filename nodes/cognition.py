"""COGNITIVE PATTERNS: the interpretation lens between perception and formation.

How a person *thinks* colours what they perceive. The engine appraises an experience the
same way for everyone (``appraisal.appraise``); this node bends that reading by who the
character currently is AND by what they remember, so the SAME event forms two different
people differently -- and lands differently on the same person depending on their past.

  * ``interpret(appraisal, personality, recalled)`` -- tilts the appraisal vector twice:
      - by current OCEAN traits (Slice 1): anxious -> more perceived threat and a darker
        valence; open -> more novelty; agreeable -> warmer on social events.
      - by memory (Slice 2): recalled similar past episodes pull the valence and threat
        *toward how those felt* (a learned expectation / schema), and the more this
        resembles lived experience, the less novel it reads (familiarity damps novelty).
    Deterministic; it colours the heuristic push (traits / values / moral all run through
    ``appraise -> impact``).
  * ``lens(personality, recalled)`` -- the same two tilts as an interpretive brief injected
    into the LLM push prompt, so the primary (Gemma) path is coloured too (it reads the raw
    text, not the appraisal). ``read_lens`` is the short version for display.

Both biases are small (``config.COGNITION_GAIN`` / ``config.MEMORY_GAIN``) and clamped, so
perception is tinted, not overwhelmed. The memory pull is *toward a bounded target* (it
asymptotes once the reading matches the remembered tone) and temperament's pull-back keeps
the perceive -> form -> perceive loop stable, so the schema reinforces without running away.
